### Changed

- AzureDevOpsDsc
  - Enabled integration tests against https://dev.azure.com/azuredevopsdsc/ (see
    comment https://github.com/dsccommunity/AzureDevOpsDsc/issues/9#issuecomment-766375424
    for more information).
  - Updated pipeline file `RequiredModules.ps1` to latest pipeline pattern.
  - Updated pipeline file `build.yaml` to latest pipeline pattern.
  - Enhanced Authentication Mechanisms.
    The classes have been refactored to accommodate a variety of authentication methods.
    This refactoring allows the system to support multiple authentication
    protocols, enhancing security and providing flexibility in integrating with
    different identity providers.
  - Added LookupResult Property to classes. A new property, LookupResult,
    has been introduced to the classes. This addition enables the classes to
    efficiently store and retrieve lookup results, improving data handling
    capabilities and streamlining processes that depend on quick access
    to these results.
  - Added [DSCGetSummaryState] class. : Introduced an additional class,
    [DSCGetSummaryState], which serves to represent the changes that have been detected.
  - The Get() and Test() methods have undergone a redesign.
    The Get-* commands now efficiently retrieve and identify complex changes,
    which are then depicted within the [DSCGetSummaryState] class.
- AzDevOpsProject
  - Added a validate set to the parameter `SourceControlType` to (for now)
    limit the parameter to the values `Git` and `Tfvc`.
  - Update comment-based help to remove text which the valid values are
    since that is now add automatically to the documentation (conceptual
    help and wiki documentation).

  - Added: ./azuredevopsdsc.common.tests.ps1
  - Added: ./azuredevopsdsc.tests.ps1
